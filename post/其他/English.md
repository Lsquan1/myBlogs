## B0004 - I need an assistant! 

A：...like I told you before, we just don't have the **resources** to hire you an assistant.

B：I understand that, but the fact is we're **understaffed**.

A：**The timing is just not right.** The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff.

B：Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? 

​      She would take some of the **weight off my shoulders.**

A：She?

B：Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could **give me a hand** with some of these projects

​      and we could keep our costs down.

A：**That sounds reasonable**... let me see what I can do.

B：Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

A：OK, great! Let's meet her!

C：Hi, I'm Adam.

​      In a few hours we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

A：Oh no! Look at that line! It must **be a mile long**! **There's no way** I'm waiting for another two hours.

B：Honey..... don't.

C：Hey man... the end of the line is over there...

A：Yeah...

C：No seriously, I was here first, and you can't **cut in line** like this.

A：Says who?

B：Just give me a second, I'll **be right up**.

A：I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!

B：But I'm quite careful when I'm **browsing** the internet, I have no idea how I could have **picked up** a virus.

A：Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; 

​      yours wasn't **up to date**, that's probably what was causing your problems.

B：Ok. Anything else?

A：What are you doing in this neighborhood? Do you live **around here**?

B：Actually, my office is right **around the corner**.

A：It was great to meet you last week at the conference. 

​      I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

C：Sure, sorry about that!

A：Someone's phone is ringing!

A：Oh, no! You're right. That's so embarrassing!

## C0010 - Driving Sales

A：All right, people. We're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our seles, 

​      and we need to do it NOW! I want **concrete solutions**. How do you intend do **drive sales**...

B：Well, in fact, we're the most expensive **in the market**, so maybe we need to lower our prices **to match the competitors**?

A：Lower our prices? Not very creative. **It'll never fly** with Swan. 

​      What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie?

C：Um, perhaps, um, a sales **promotion**. Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that!

A：What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO will **be here any minute**.

D：Do we have any ideas yet?

C：Yes Mr. Swan, we were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive.

D：A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. It sounds like something we should consider.

A：Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that's a **brilliant** idea! I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.

## C0011 - New Guy in Town

A：Oh, **I don't know if you heard**, but someone moved into that old house down th road.

B：Yeah, I know. I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in. His name is Armand.

A：Really? What's he like? You have to **fill me in**.

B：Actually, he's a bit strange. I don't know... I've got **a bad feeling** about him.

A：Really? Why?

B：Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really **weird**, 

​	  and then he practically **kicked me out**! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, 

​      but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look. 

 	 The whole thing really **creeped me out**.

A：Well, **you'll never guess** what I saw this morning. A delivery truck pulled into his driveway, 

​	  and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin!

B：You see! Why would he...

C：Hello ladies...

B：Ah, Armand! You **scared the heck out of me**! This is my friend Doris.

C：A pleasure to meet you... If you are not doing anything tonight, 

​      I would like to have you both for dinner. I mean... I woule like to have you both over for dinner.

​	  so why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

A：Sure that's fine. Here is the list of all the things you need to get. 

​	  Don't forget anything! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

B：Hey, honey I'm back. Wow, the house looks really good!

## C0013 - Out Of Control Spending 

A：Ok, so now the last point on our agenda. Jill, let's **go over** the profit and loss statement.

B：Great. Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are **through the roof**.

A：Let's see... These numbers are off the charts! What's going on here!

B：Well, um, sir, the company **expenditures** on entertainment and travel are **out of control**. 

​	  Look at these bills for example. Just this month we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges!

B：The list **goes on and on**. Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments!

A：Thank you; that will be all. I'll **take care of** it.

B：Look at this one sir, eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called "Wild Things"?!

A：Ok, I get it!! Thank you for your very thorough analysis!
